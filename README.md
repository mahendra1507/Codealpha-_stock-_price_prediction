1. **Objective:** The goal is to predict Tata Steel's stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). 
2. **Data Preparation:** Historical stock price data for Tata Steel is collected, and the dataset is preprocessed, including normalization to ensure uniform scale.
3. **Feature Selection:** The LSTM model is trained on a specific feature, such as the closing prices, which is crucial for predicting future stock values.
4. **Sliding Windows:** The dataset is structured into input-output pairs using a sliding window approach, allowing the LSTM to learn sequential patterns in the stock price data.
5. **Model Architecture:** An LSTM neural network is constructed with appropriate layers, such as LSTM and Dense layers, configured for time-series prediction.
6. **Training:** The model is trained on a subset of the data, optimizing parameters through backpropagation and minimizing the mean squared error loss.
7. **Validation:** The model's performance is evaluated on a validation set, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning of hyperparameters like epochs, batch size, and LSTM units is performed to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
9. **Testing:** The trained LSTM model is tested on a separate test set to assess its ability to forecast Tata Steel stock prices accurately.
10. **Evaluation:** The model's predictive performance is evaluated using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), providing insights into its reliability for future price predictions.
